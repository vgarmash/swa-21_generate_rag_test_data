## Entry #10

*Date: July 01, 0050 BC*
*Location: Roman Camp*

Obelix and I went menhir hunting today. Found a particularly fine specimen near Menhir Quarry (see: ENCY_ENCY_015) (see: LETT_LETTER_004). Must remember to avoid the wild boar traps!

*Observation:* Noticed Roman scouts near the northern border. (see: JOUR_JOURN_008)
