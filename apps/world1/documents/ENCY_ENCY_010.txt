# Menhir Types and Uses

Menhirs are large, shaped standing stones used for ceremonial purposes and as Obelix's primary trade.
Classification includes: Standard (2m), Grande (3m), and Colossal (4m+).
Quarrying techniques involve careful splitting along natural stone lines.
Delivery logistics remain a mystery, as Obelix transports them single-handedly without visible strain.
