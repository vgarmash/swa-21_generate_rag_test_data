# Gallic Village Structure

The Armorican Village is structured around a central square with Chief Vitalstatistix's hut at the highest point.
Key infrastructure includes Getafix's potion laboratory, the menhir quarry, and the fishmonger's stall.
Defense relies on natural forest barriers and the strategic use of magic potion.
Social hierarchy places the chief at the top, followed by warriors, then craftsmen, with the bard (Cacofonix) nominally respected but often restrained.
