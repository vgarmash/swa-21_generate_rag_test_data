## Entry #47

*Date: October 08, 0050 BC*
*Location: Lutetia*

Today we had another encounter with the Romans. Julius Caesar tried to attack our village, but as usual, (See related documents on Magic Potion) made short work of them.

*Observation:* Cacofonix is practicing a new song. May the gods help us all (see: MYTH_MYTH_003). (see: ENCY_ENCY_013)
