Dear Roman Command,

I hope this letter finds you well. Things here in the village are as chaotic as ever (see: ENCY_ENCY_012). Fulliautomatix and Unhygienix had another fight today.

Remember what we discussed about the next feast.

Yours sincerely,
Roman_Soldier

P.S (see: LETT_LETTER_005). Bring more olive oil next time. (see: ENCY_ENCY_003)
