{"template_type": "chain_of_thought", "question": "Compare and contrast the leadership styles of Lugous and the Imperial commander, analyzing their effectiveness in their respective contexts.", "answer": "Lugous employs consensual, tradition-based leadership emphasizing community cohesion and adaptive defense. The Imperial commander uses hierarchical, discipline-focused command prioritizing expansion and control. Lugous's style excels in maintaining morale and leveraging local knowledge but struggles with rapid large-scale coordination. The Imperial approach enables efficient large-force management but fails against unconventional resistance and alienates local populations. Effectiveness depends entirely on context: Imperial methods work for territorial control, while Lugous's approach succeeds in community defense.", "source_docs": ["ENCY_001", "REPO_001", "REPO_002", "JOUR_001"], "difficulty": "hard", "category": "leadership", "context_required": true, "reasoning_steps": ["Extract leadership principles from {chief}'s documented decisions", "Analyze Imperial command structure from military documents", "Compare outcomes in specific documented conflicts", "Evaluate adaptability to different situations", "Assess long-term effectiveness in respective goals"]}
