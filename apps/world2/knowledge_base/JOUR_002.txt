## Journal Entry #88

*Date: Day 25 of the Planting Season*
*Location: at the base of Elder Mountain*
*Weather: Misty*
*Mood: hopeful*

Today was eventful. Syloos showed me a new herbal preparation.

**Observation:** The crystal formations hum differently at night.

**Personal note:** The new batch of moonleaf seems particularly potent.
