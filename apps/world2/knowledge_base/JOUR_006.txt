## Journal Entry #13

*Date: Day 18 of the Planting Season*
*Location: in the Crystalwood Grove*
*Weather: Clear*
*Mood: weary*

Today was eventful. I discovered unusual crystals while exploring.

**Observation:** The seasons are changing earlier than expected.

**Personal note:** The new batch of moonleaf seems particularly potent.
