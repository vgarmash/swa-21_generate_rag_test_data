## Journal Entry #95

*Date: Day 15 of the Harvest Season*
*Location: near the Whispering Falls*
*Weather: Clear*
*Mood: contemplative*

Today was eventful. I discovered ancient runes while exploring.

**Observation:** Our food stores are adequate for the coming winter.

**Personal note:** Must remember to check the northern watchtower tomorrow.
