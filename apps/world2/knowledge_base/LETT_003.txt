To Trusted Friend,

I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. The seasons turn as always, though not without their peculiarities.

Since we last corresponded, much has changed in our corner of the world.

Specifically, relations with the mountain clans remain cordial.

I must share that unanswered questions continue to occupy my thoughts. This relates to relationships that shape our collective future.

On a more personal note, each day reaffirms the value of community.

I would value your perspective on these matters when opportunity permits (see document: MYTH_005 for details). Please convey my regards to your family.

With sincerity and anticipation of your reply,

Taraix

P.S (additional information available in ENCY_003) (contrasting viewpoint in MYTH_004) (practical applications documented in MYTH_002). The next caravan should reach your area within two moon cycles.
