## Journal Entry #15

*Date: First Moon of Sunfire*
*Location: in the Crystalwood Grove*
*Weather: Rainy*
*Mood: contemplative*

Today was eventful. Syloos showed me a new herbal preparation.

**Observation:** The seasons are changing earlier than expected.

**Personal note:** Quenix broke another tool today - need to speak with Taraix.
