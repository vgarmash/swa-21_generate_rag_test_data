## Journal Entry #4

*Date: Second Moon of Sunfire*
*Location: in the Crystalwood Grove*
*Weather: Rainy*
*Mood: weary*

Today was eventful. The community gathered for the monthly festival.

**Observation:** Our food stores are adequate for the coming winter.

**Personal note:** The new batch of moonleaf seems particularly potent.
