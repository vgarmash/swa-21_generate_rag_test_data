## Journal Entry #81

*Date: Midday on the 3th of Silvermonth*
*Location: along the Starlight River*
*Weather: Misty*
*Mood: hopeful*

Today was eventful. I discovered a hidden cave while exploring.

**Observation:** The seasons are changing earlier than expected.

**Personal note:** The dreams have been more vivid since visiting the crystal cave.
