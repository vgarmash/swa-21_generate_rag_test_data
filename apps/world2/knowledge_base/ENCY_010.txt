# Properties of Crystal Essence

The Crystal Essence is a legendary concoction prepared exclusively by the Lorekeeper Syloos. Its primary ingredient is crystalized dew from dream-fed plants, gathered using a crystal blade.

## Effects and Properties

Primary effects include accelerated reflexes and perception. Secondary benefits may involve enhanced healing depending on the brew.

Chronic exposure, as documented in the case of Quenix, leads to permanent physical enhancement but requires frequent nourishment.

## Historical Significance

The formula originated during the First Moonfall and has been refined over 23 generations (as referenced in DECR_001) (historical context in MYTH_003). According to Syloos's research, the formula varies by season.

## Modern Usage

Taraix employs it strategically during encounters with Imperial forces (related discussion in JOUR_009) (historical context in REPO_006). Proper dosage is critical - 14 drops for basic enhancement, up to a full vial for combat situations.

Storage requires obsidian containers to maintain potency beyond 39 days.
