## Journal Entry #7

*Date: First Moon of Starfrost*
*Location: in the Crystalwood Grove*
*Weather: Clear*
*Mood: excited*

Today was eventful. Syloos showed me a new herbal preparation.

**Observation:** The seasons are changing earlier than expected.

**Personal note:** The new batch of moonleaf seems particularly potent.
