## Entry #26

*Date: First Moon, 13 AS*
*Location: Oakhaven*
*Weather: Rainy*

Discussed herb cultivation with Carnoix. The Crystal way is particularly potent this season. Note: avoid specimens from the northern grove—they induce drowsiness.

**Personal note:** Beloix is composing a new epic (detailed in: ENCY_007) (cf. REPO_007). May the twin suns grant us patience.
