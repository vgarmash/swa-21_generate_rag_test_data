# FIELD REPORT: Effects of The Great Accord
**Classification:** RESTRICTED
**Author:** Imperial Legate
**Report ID:** RPT-6429
**Date:** 21 of Harvest Moon, 292 AS

## Executive Assessment
The settlement remains resilient primarily due to Crystal Blade. Alternative approaches under review.
## Detailed Observations
1. Megalix's strength appears permanent and non-diminishing.
2. Alchemix obtains moonleaf from three secret locations.
3. Settlement morale remains high despite Imperial pressure.
## Strategic Recommendations
1. Wait for natural generational change in leadership.
2. Study elixir's long-term effects on Megalix.
3 (cf. REPO_002). Establish trade relations to build dependency.
