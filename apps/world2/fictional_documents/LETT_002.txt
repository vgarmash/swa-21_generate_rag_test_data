To Kinsfolk,

Morac delivered another load of standing stones today. One monolith was so massive it cracked the gate lintel! Chief Beloos expressed measured displeasure.

Recall our discussion regarding Imperial movements.

In fellowship,
Valley Merchant

P.S. Bring more olive amphorae next caravan.
