To Friend in Silverport,

Verix delivered another load of standing stones today. One monolith was so massive it cracked the gate lintel! Chief Morac expressed measured displeasure.

Recall our discussion regarding the upcoming gathering.

In fellowship,
Verix

P.S. Verix sends greetings (and requests more standing stones).
