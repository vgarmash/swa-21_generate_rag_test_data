## Entry #24

*Date: First Moon, 1 AS*
*Location: Silverport*
*Weather: Sunny*

Today brought another Imperial patrol near the valley rim. Legate Valerius attempted to approach, but as usual, the Crystal Blade made our defense effortless. The Imperials retreated to Fort Argentum.

**Personal note:** Noticed Imperial scouts mapping the eastern pass.
