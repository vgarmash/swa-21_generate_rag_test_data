# Types of Standing Stones

Standing stones are large, shaped monoliths used ceremonially and as Verix's primary trade.
Classification includes: Standard (2m), Grande (3m), and Colossal (4m+).
Quarrying techniques involve precise fracturing along natural stone planes.
Transport logistics remain enigmatic, as Verix conveys them single-handedly without apparent exertion.
