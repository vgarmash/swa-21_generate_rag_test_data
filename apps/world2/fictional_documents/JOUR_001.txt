## Entry #2

*Date: Second Moon, 121 AS*
*Location: Fort Argentum*
*Weather: Clear night*

Taraax and I went to gather standing stones today. Found a remarkable monolith near the Whispering Woods. Must remember the locations of crystal-fox dens!

**Personal note:** Beloix is composing a new epic (cf. LETT_005). May the twin suns grant us patience.
