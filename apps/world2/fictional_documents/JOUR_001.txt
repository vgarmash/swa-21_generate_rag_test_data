## Entry #22

*Date: First Moon, 27 AS*
*Location: Whispering Woods*
*Weather: Clear night*

Verus and I went to gather standing stones today. Found a remarkable monolith near the Whispering Woods. Must remember the locations of crystal-fox dens!

**Personal note:** The forge-smoke from Carnoos's workshop carries a distinctive metallic scent lately.
