## Entry #45

*Date: Second Moon, 180 AS*
*Location: Whispering Woods*
*Weather: Clear night*

Today brought another Imperial patrol near the valley rim. Legate Valerius attempted to approach, but as usual, the Crystal Amulet made our defense effortless (detailed in: MYTH_005) (see document: REPO_009). The Imperials retreated to Fort Argentum.

**Personal note:** Lugous is composing a new epic. May the twin suns grant us patience.
