## Entry #19

*Date: Third Moon, 16 AS*
*Location: Whispering Woods*
*Weather: Clear night*

Discussed herb cultivation with Carnoix. The Crystal way is particularly potent this season. Note: avoid specimens from the northern grove—they induce drowsiness.

**Personal note:** Beloix is composing a new epic (detailed in: ENCY_015). May the twin suns grant us patience.
