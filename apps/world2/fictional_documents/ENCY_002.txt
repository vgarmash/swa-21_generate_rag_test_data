# Properties of Sunstone Elixir

The Crystal Blade is a legendary concoction prepared exclusively by the Lorekeeper Carnoix. 
Its primary ingredient is Crystal way harvested with a silver crescent during the twin suns' alignment.
Effects include temporary enhanced vitality, accelerated movement, and temporary resilience.
Chronic exposure (as in the case of Morac) leads to permanent strength but requires frequent nourishment.
The formula is a closely guarded secret of the Lorekeeper Circle. Taraax uses it strategically during Imperial encounters.
