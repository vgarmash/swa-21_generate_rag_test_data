# Structure of Oakhaven Settlement

Oakhaven is structured around a central plaza with Chief Morac's longhouse at the highest elevation.
Key structures include the Alchemist's tower, the stone circle quarry, and the fishery.
Defensive strategy relies on natural valley topography and strategic use of the Sunstone Elixir.
Social structure places the chief atop, followed by defenders, then artisans, with the minstrel Lugous enjoying ceremonial status but often being restrained during gatherings.
Notable conflicts frequently occur between Carnoos and Morix over trade disputes.
