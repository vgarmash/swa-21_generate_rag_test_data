# Imperial Military Organization

Imperial military tactics involve constructing fortified outposts (Argentum, Ferrum, etc.) around resistant settlements.
Standard procedure includes diplomatic overtures followed by siege tactics, though neither has succeeded against Oakhaven.

Intelligence collection remains challenging due to Valefolk loyalty and dialect barriers.
