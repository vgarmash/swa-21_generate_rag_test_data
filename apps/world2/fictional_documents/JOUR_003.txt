## Entry #48

*Date: Second Moon, 300 AS*
*Location: Whispering Woods*
*Weather: Sunny*

Taraax and I went to gather standing stones today. Found a remarkable monolith near the Whispering Woods. Must remember the locations of crystal-fox dens!

**Personal note:** The Golden Orb roast was exceptionally flavorful tonight.
