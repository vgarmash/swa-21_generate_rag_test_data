## Entry #12

*Date: Third Moon, 162 AS*
*Location: Oakhaven*
*Weather: Rainy*

Verus and I went to gather standing stones today. Found a remarkable monolith near the Whispering Woods. Must remember the locations of crystal-fox dens!

**Personal note:** The forge-smoke from Carnoos's workshop carries a distinctive metallic scent lately.
