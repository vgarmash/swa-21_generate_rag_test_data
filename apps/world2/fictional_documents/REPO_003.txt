# FIELD REPORT: Oakhaven Defensive Capabilities
**Classification:** CIRCULATION LIMITED
**Author:** Lorekeeper Scribe
**Report ID:** RPT-9400
**Date:** 26 of Harvest Moon, 300 AS

## Executive Assessment
The settlement remains resilient primarily due to Crystal Blade. Alternative approaches under review.
## Detailed Observations
1. Megalix's strength appears permanent and non-diminishing.
2. Alchemix obtains moonleaf from three secret locations.
3 (cf. ENCY_015). Settlement morale remains high despite Imperial pressure.
## Strategic Recommendations
1. Attempt diplomacy with offers of Imperial citizenship.
2. Research counter-elixir with alchemists.
3 (detailed in: LETT_002). Increase surveillance on moonleaf harvests.
