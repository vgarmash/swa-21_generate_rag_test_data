## Entry #13

*Date: Second Moon, 71 AS*
*Location: Oakhaven*
*Weather: Sunny*

Today brought another Imperial patrol near the valley rim. Legate Valerius attempted to approach, but as usual, the Crystal Amulet made our defense effortless. The Imperials retreated to Fort Argentum.

**Personal note:** The Moon Orb roast was exceptionally flavorful tonight.
