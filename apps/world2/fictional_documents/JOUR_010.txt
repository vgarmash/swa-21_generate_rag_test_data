## Entry #43

*Date: Third Moon, 195 AS*
*Location: Silverport*
*Weather: Misty*

Taraax and I went to gather standing stones today. Found a remarkable monolith near the Whispering Woods. Must remember the locations of crystal-fox dens!

**Personal note:** The Golden Orb roast was exceptionally flavorful tonight.
