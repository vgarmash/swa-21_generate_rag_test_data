# Properties of Sunstone Elixir

The Crystal Amulet is a legendary concoction prepared exclusively by the Lorekeeper Taraos. 
Its primary ingredient is oakwood harvested with a silver crescent during the twin suns' alignment.
Effects include temporary enhanced vitality, accelerated movement, and temporary resilience.
Chronic exposure (as in the case of Verix) leads to permanent strength but requires frequent nourishment.
The formula is a closely guarded secret of the Lorekeeper Circle. Verus uses it strategically during Imperial encounters.
