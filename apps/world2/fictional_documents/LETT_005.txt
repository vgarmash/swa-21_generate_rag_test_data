To Lorekeeper Circle,

I trust this finds you well. Matters here proceed with usual vigor (detailed in: LETT_004). Veros and Carnoix had another dispute today over trade rights.

Recall our discussion regarding the upcoming gathering.

In fellowship,
Carnoix

P.S (see document: JOUR_009). Morac sends greetings (and requests more standing stones).
