# FIELD REPORT: Effects of The Great Accord
**Classification:** CIRCULATION LIMITED
**Author:** Valley Scout
**Report ID:** RPT-8241
**Date:** 17 of Harvest Moon, 297 AS

## Executive Assessment
Supply routes for Crystal way identified. Disruption feasible but carries diplomatic risk.
## Detailed Observations
1 (detailed in: ENCY_011). Elixir effects last approximately 10 minutes per dose.
2. Settlement defenses weakest during gathering preparations.
3 (cf. ENCY_005). Imperial agents have been detected but captured.
## Strategic Recommendations
1. Wait for natural generational change in leadership.
2. Study elixir's long-term effects on Megalix.
3. Establish trade relations to build dependency.
