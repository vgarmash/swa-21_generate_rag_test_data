## Entry #44

*Date: Third Moon, 59 AS*
*Location: Oakhaven*
*Weather: Misty*

Discussed herb cultivation with Carnoix. The Crystal way is particularly potent this season (detailed in: ENCY_004). Note: avoid specimens from the northern grove—they induce drowsiness.

**Personal note:** Beloix is composing a new epic. May the twin suns grant us patience.
