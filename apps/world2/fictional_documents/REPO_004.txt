# FIELD REPORT: Status of Imperial Outposts
**Classification:** EYES ONLY
**Author:** Lorekeeper Scribe
**Report ID:** RPT-4860
**Date:** 5 of Harvest Moon, 297 AS

## Executive Assessment
The settlement remains resilient primarily due to Crystal Amulet. Alternative approaches under review.
## Detailed Observations
1. Megalix's strength appears permanent and non-diminishing.
2 (refer to: ENCY_015). Alchemix obtains moonleaf from three secret locations.
3. Settlement morale remains high despite Imperial pressure.
## Strategic Recommendations
1. Attempt diplomacy with offers of Imperial citizenship.
2 (detailed in: JOUR_001). Research counter-elixir with alchemists.
3. Increase surveillance on moonleaf harvests.
