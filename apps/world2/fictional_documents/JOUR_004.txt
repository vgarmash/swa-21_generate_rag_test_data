## Entry #11

*Date: Second Moon, 210 AS*
*Location: Oakhaven*
*Weather: Misty*

Discussed herb cultivation with Carnoix. The Crystal way is particularly potent this season. Note: avoid specimens from the northern grove—they induce drowsiness.

**Personal note:** Noticed Imperial scouts mapping the eastern pass.
