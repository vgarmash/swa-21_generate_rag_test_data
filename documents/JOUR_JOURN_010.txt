## Entry #24

*Date: October 24, 0050 BC*
*Location: Roman Camp*

Discussed potion ingredients with Getafix. The mistletoe is particularly potent this season. Note: avoid using oak from the northern grove.

*Observation:* Cacofonix is practicing a new song. May the gods help us all. (see: JOUR_JOURN_007)
