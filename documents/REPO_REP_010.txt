# REPORT: Village Defenses
**Classification:** INTERNAL
**Reporter:** Druid Observer
**Date:** 45 BC

## Executive Summary
Internal village conflicts observed between blacksmith and fishmonger. Could be exploitable.
## Findings

2. Getafix obtains mistletoe from three secret locations.
3. Village morale remains high despite Roman pressure.
## Recommendations
1. Wait for natural generational change in leadership.
2. Study potion's long-term effects on Obelix.
3 (see: JOUR_JOURN_001). Establish trade relations to build dependency.
