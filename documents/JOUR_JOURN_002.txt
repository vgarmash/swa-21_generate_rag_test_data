## Entry #23

*Date: December 06, 0050 BC*
*Location: Armorican Village*

Today we had another encounter with the Romans. Julius Caesar tried to attack our village, but as usual, (See related documents on Magic Potion) made short work of them.

*Observation:* The wild boar seems particularly plentiful this season.
