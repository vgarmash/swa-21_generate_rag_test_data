Dear Friend in Lutetia,

I hope this letter finds you well. Things here in the village are as chaotic as ever (see: ENCY_ENCY_007). Fulliautomatix and Unhygienix had another fight today.

Remember what we discussed about the next feast.

Yours sincerely,
Roman_Soldier

P.S (see: DECR_DECR_005) (see: REPO_REP_002). Don't forget the boar for the feast!
