## Entry #15

*Date: July 07, 0050 BC*
*Location: Armorican Village*

Today we had another encounter with the Romans. Julius Caesar tried to attack our village, but as usual, (See related documents on Magic Potion) made short work of them.

*Observation:* Cacofonix is practicing a new song (see: ENCY_ENCY_011). May the gods help us all.
