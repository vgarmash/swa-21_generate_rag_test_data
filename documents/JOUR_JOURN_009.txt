## Entry #42

*Date: July 25, 0050 BC*
*Location: Lutetia*

Today we had another encounter with the Romans. Julius Caesar tried to attack our village, but as usual, (See related documents on Magic Potion) made short work of them.

*Observation:* Cacofonix is practicing a new song (see: JOUR_JOURN_003) (see: ENCY_ENCY_001) (see: MYTH_MYTH_002). May the gods help us all.
