## Entry #23

*Date: October 02, 0050 BC*
*Location: Lutetia*

Another feast tonight. As expected, Cacofonix started singing and had to be restrained. The fish from Unhygienix was particularly salty today.

*Observation:* Cacofonix is practicing a new song (see: REPO_REP_001). May the gods help us all.
