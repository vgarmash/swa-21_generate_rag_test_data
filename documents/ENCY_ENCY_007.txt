# Magic Potion Properties

The Magic Potion is a legendary concoction brewed exclusively by the druid Getafix. 
Its primary ingredient is mistletoe harvested with a golden sickle during the full moon.
Effects include temporary superhuman strength, increased speed, and invulnerability.
Note: Permanent exposure (as in Obelix's case) leads to chronic strength but no other known side effects.
The recipe is a closely guarded secret of the druidic circle.
