# Roman Military Tactics

Roman military tactics in Gaul involve the construction of fortified camps (Babaorum, Laudanum, etc.) surrounding resistant villages.
Standard procedure includes attempted diplomacy, followed by siege tactics, though neither has succeeded against the Armorican village.
Caesar's forces are known for their discipline, engineering prowess, and persistence despite repeated defeats.
Intelligence gathering remains a challenge due to Gaulish loyalty and the language barrier.
