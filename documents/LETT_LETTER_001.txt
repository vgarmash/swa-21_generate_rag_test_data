Dear Druid Circle,

Obelix delivered another batch of menhirs today. One was so large it broke the village gate! Chief Chief Vitalstatistix was not amused.

Remember what we discussed about the potion formula.

Yours sincerely,
Getafix

P.S (see: DECR_DECR_005). Obelix says hello (and wants more menhirs) (see: LETT_LETTER_005). (see: ENCY_ENCY_009)
