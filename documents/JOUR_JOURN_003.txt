## Entry #29

*Date: February 23, 0050 BC*
*Location: Armorican Village*

Obelix and I went menhir hunting today. Found a particularly fine specimen near Getafix's Hut (see: ENCY_ENCY_009). Must remember to avoid the wild boar traps!

*Observation:* The wild boar seems particularly plentiful this season (see: JOUR_JOURN_005). (see: MYTH_MYTH_005)
